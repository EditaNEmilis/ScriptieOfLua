# ROBLOX

**Roblox** is a multiplayer game, most games here runs with Lua scripting.

## Luau

Roblox's Lua for game scripting is called **Luau**.

**Luau** is the scripting language creators use in *Roblox Studio*. It is a fast, small, safe, gradually typed embeddable scripting language derived from Lua 5.1 version.

## Examples

*'Hello World!'*:

```luau
-- Basic and simple print function
print("Hello World!")
```

*Loop*:
```luau
-- Print by 10 times from looping by i
for i = 1, 10 do
    print(i)
end
```

### Script/Local

**Script** is for only the serverside for ingame function. *(eg. Parts, Decals)*

**LocalScript** is for only the clientside for ingame players. *(eg. Character, Player camera)*
