# ScriptieOfLua

## A ~~libary~~ library of LUA codes...

A repo that contains mostly of LUA scripts/files. Inculdes **Roblox, Garry's Mod** and so on.

Currently in the repo:

* **Roblox**: Currently most scripts in this folder.
* **Garry's Mod**: Source game with LUA support, still not much as Roblox.
* **Clickteam Fusion**: A 2D (and 3D for Firefly), has support for LUA as a object called **XLua**.
* **Polytoria**: Roblox clone, has similar scripting system to Roblox.

### Why?

As an archive or library to contain *every* type of LUA in each game (or program) genres

~~But that's another time to dream on..~~
